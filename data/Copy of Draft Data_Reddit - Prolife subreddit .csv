 Freedom of speech means the government cant shut you up, not that the government owes you a megaphone.
 
 Even if there was a right to an abortion (which there isnt), theres no way theres a right to get the government to pay for it.
 
 The meaning of the word rights has come to mean a list of entitlements. Education, health care, etc. Im not opposed to government provided education or healthcare, necessarily& but it should never be construed as a right. A right to healthcare, in my mind, would be the government cant prevent you from seeking treatment, not that the government is obligated to pay.",1

 You are not alone. I repeat you are not alone. I was conceived in rape, and my biological grandmother wanted to force my biological mother to murder me in the womb. When I finally connected with my biological mother she shared horror stories of how her phone mother treated her while she was pregnant with me. She was forced to go out of state to have me in your own siblings didnt know she was ever pregnant. When she heard a Roman Catholic couple was going to adopt me she thought I would be raised rich because all she knew about Roman Catholics was the Kennedy family, and having just turned 19 didnt know any better but not every Roman Catholic was rich. She also didnt know that Walmart family that adopted me was extremely for which was OK by me as he taught me many lessons today value today, she didnt know my adoptive father is an alcoholic who is severely abusing his wife in with soon abuse me and all manner always did I hate talking about. 
 
 The family that adopted me did show because they did not want to stick out amongst their neighbors. Theres an old saying live like the Joneses such that if the Joneses have two cars you have two cars if the Joneses have a white picket fence you have a white picket fence and so on. So they literally did have a white picket fence and shes most of the neighborhood had two children they adopted two children.
 
 I was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused from around the age of five or six until I was thrown out of the house at the age of 19 to live on my own. In the physical did include worse.
 
 For 28 years I was pro abortion. I also hated God deeply. I did not find out I was adopted until I was seven years old when my grandmother who is the one who is predominantly raising me they were so safe to be around told me I was adopted. My alcoholic father disowned his own mother and would not allow me to go back to her for safety. He would tell me several times a week I was trash am I old mother didnt even want me.
 
 Jesus Christ shines the most high and only God saved me at age 28. He provided a miracle of allowing me to find my biological mother when it was a closed adoption. And between learning basic human biology as well as faith being in complete agreement with basic biology and basic science came to understand human life starts at conception in all life is valuable.
 
 There are a number of people strongly believe that if youre going to suffer or you should be killed before you go through the suffering. There are those who wouldve had me murdered in the womb because I was conceived in rape. There are those who think I would be better off dead because I grew up extremely poor. Ill never understand that point of view. My life is far from perfect. And Im sure if you gathered up the majority of the pro-life community we would all share similar stories of an imperfect life with more suffering that most can imagine and yet we still value life.
 
 You are not alone! Continue to stand firm! God bless.",1

 If you are actually recommending or promoting abortion based on someone's circumstances (such as financial, college, or career situations), that's not pro-choice, that is advocating for abortions to happen, or pro-abortion, and that puts peer pressure on mothers to commit abortion whether they really wanted to or not, and it can make them feel guilty for not aborting/killing.
 
 I often see abortion promoted as ""the right thing to do"" for most if not nearly all circumstances someone might find themselves in, which is not pro-choice, that's pro-abortion.
 
 Pro-choice means you want abortion to be legal in case the mother decides to choose it. But the moment you recommend or promote abortion for particular circumstances, you are now advocating that abortions happen in those circumstances and trying to get mothers to make that decision, rather than advocating that the mother choose without that societal pressure.

 I've never encountered a pro-choice argument from liberalism that I've found convincing. Abortion violates the individual rights of the unborn. 
 
 Thus, it seems obvious that abortion is not moral according to liberal ethics. However, liberalism is ineffectual in guaranteeing that people act morally because humans make decisions based upon emotion. People rationalize choices that contradict their stated values. 
 
 In an ideal liberal society, people would act rationally for their own benefit and stop acting for their own benefit when it violated the non-aggression principle. But of course, people often keep acting for their own benefit even when it violates others' individual rights. The pro-choice position is nonsensical within a liberal, capitalist framework because **even rational choice the and ""invisible hand"" model** **recognize that people make choices based upon external situations**. It would be one thing if people always acted morally regardless of the consequences to themselves, but people don't. 
 
 Pro-choicers argue that abortion can be a moral choice, but the choice is never made in a morally-neutral context. Let's be honest about it: being a parent is extremely hard work, and becoming a parent is a huge commitment. Even if the biological parents of an infant choose to give up their kid for adoption, the uncertainty of whether or not an adoptive family will be found, the legal process, and the disruption of the parents' ""regular"", desired lives by the birth of child all can be seen as negative events the parents want to avoid. To be sure, there are many, many, many reasons that the parents of an aborted child might cite for why abortion was the right choicethey may *believe* that they were sparing their child from more suffering. However, the reasons people cite for getting abortions aside, the choice to abort is never made in a completely neutral context, wherein there's no option that's easier or better for the parents. When people choose abortion, they are acting rationally according to economic theorythey're acting in their own self-interest based upon a circumstance. If having conceived a child were not inconvenient to the parents, then they wouldn't even be considering abortion. No parents decide to abort a child they wanted who was conceived at a convenient time. Abortion is only considered at times when self-interest may well, well cause parents of unwanted children to decide to violate the non-aggression principle.",4_1

Environmental degradation is one salient example. No C-suite executive of a petroleum company decides to continue operating the company even though burning fossil fuels is causing climate change in a morally-neutral context. The options for the oil executive are: 1) do the right thing and lose his or her job, shares of stock, and possibly other material possessions while in the process of switching industries; or 2) continue to profit while destroying the Earth. It's not as if the owner of a large amount of stock in a company with unethical business practices is not violating the non-aggression principle. Yet, people argue that the individual's right to his or her private property is more important than that person ceasing to violate others' individual rights to life, health, and sustainable futuresbecause people are willing to contradict their stated values of individual rights if it's in their own best interest. 
 
  
 In short, a value system that regards individual rights as the end-all and be-all for a just society is flawed. People cannot respect each other's individual rights unless each person recognizes that obedience to moral authority is a vital, important restriction of individual freedom. Conservatives thus argue that individual commitment to moral actionobedience to God by the members of a societyis sufficient to prevent people from acting selfishly, and that legal and economic liberalism can continue. Leftists argue that society needs to restrict the legal and economic freedoms of individuals because people make decisions according to self-interest, and will continue to act in ways that harm others until there are negative consequences that make harming others costly. Although these proposals for how selfish behavior must be controlled are divergent, both conservatives and leftists agree (in theory) that there is a higher authority for morality than the individual.",4_1_1

 3. In Texas anyone can bring a lawsuit against anyone they believe was involved in an abortion. 
 
 4. Catholic hospitals operate under Catholic directives and will not perform abortions. When a woman presents with an incomplete miscarriage, they prescribe expectant management and will not deliver the fetus if it still has cardiac activity or unless the woman is in immediate danger.

 It seems odd to me that doctors feel like they can't induce labor early and offer palliative care in this situation. It seems like that would be a lot safer than putting her on a plane to Colorado and killing the baby and THEN inducing labor.
 
 The problem here is that doctors want to push for abortion rather than allow for any risk of sepsis. In reality, some women with PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) are able to remain pregnant and give birth to healthy babies.
 
 From a study that specifically focused on PPROM between 14 and 24 weeks (pre-viability):
 
 ""Previable PPROM represents a rare but significant challenge to obstetricians in terms of management. Most cases are managed expectantly. Despite advances in obstetric and neonatal care, perinatal prognosis remains poor. However, the risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality is low. A quarter of these women can take home a live baby.""
 
 https://www.jcgo.org/index.php/jcgo/article/view/466/312
 
 Assuming the NPR article is true, the course they chose seems MUCH more risky than expectant management and immediate delivery (without feticide) in case of infection. Especially since antibiotics exist.",4

 And for the 10k bounty to happen a judge or jury would have to find the defendant, aka the hospital guilty. Which is unlikely that would happen with a legit ""her life is in danger"" case.
 
 Outside of these cases, non miscarriaged fetuses shoudlnt be aborted at the very first risky situation
 
 Also the reason Texas lawmakers have to specify that only grave health cases can be allowed to get an abortion is because 9therw8se, pro choice doctors would chalk up the simplest health issue (high blood pressure for a short time) as a reas9n for abortion.

 If you are actually recommending or promoting abortion based on someone's circumstances (such as financial, college, or career situations), that's not pro-choice, that is advocating for abortions to happen, or pro-abortion, and that puts peer pressure on mothers to commit abortion whether they really wanted to or not, and it can make them feel guilty for not aborting/killing.
 
 I often see abortion promoted as ""the right thing to do"" for most if not nearly all circumstances someone might find themselves in, which is not pro-choice, that's pro-abortion.
 
 Pro-choice means you want abortion to be legal in case the mother decides to choose it. But the moment you recommend or promote abortion for particular circumstances, you are now advocating that abortions happen in those circumstances and trying to get mothers to make that decision, rather than advocating that the mother choose without that societal pressure. Recommending abortion for particular circumstances means you want more abortions to happen, at least as long as those circumstances apply.",4

 I've never encountered a pro-choice argument from liberalism that I've found convincing. Abortion violates the individual rights of the unborn. 
 
 Thus, it seems obvious that abortion is not moral according to liberal ethics. However, liberalism is ineffectual in guaranteeing that people act morally because humans make decisions based upon emotion. People rationalize choices that contradict their stated values. 
 
 In an ideal liberal society, people would act rationally for their own benefit and stop acting for their own benefit when it violated the non-aggression principle. But of course, people often keep acting for their own benefit even when it violates others' individual rights. The pro-choice position is nonsensical within a liberal, capitalist framework because **even rational choice the and ""invisible hand"" model** **recognize that people make choices based upon external situations**. It would be one thing if people always acted morally regardless of the consequences to themselves, but people don't. 
 
 Pro-choicers argue that abortion can be a moral choice, but the choice is never made in a morally-neutral context. Let's be honest about it: being a parent is extremely hard work, and becoming a parent is a huge commitment. Even if the biological parents of an infant choose to give up their kid for adoption, the uncertainty of whether or not an adoptive family will be found, the legal process, and the disruption of the parents' ""regular"", desired lives by the birth of child all can be seen as negative events the parents want to avoid. To be sure, there are many, many, many reasons that the parents of an aborted child might cite for why abortion was the right choicethey may *believe* that they were sparing their child from more suffering. However, the reasons people cite for getting abortions aside, the choice to abort is never made in a completely neutral context, wherein there's no option that's easier or better for the parents. When people choose abortion, they are acting rationally according to economic theorythey're acting in their own self-interest based upon a circumstance. If having conceived a child were not inconvenient to the parents, then they wouldn't even be considering abortion. No parents decide to abort a child they wanted who was conceived at a convenient time. Abortion is only considered at times when self-interest may well, well cause parents of unwanted children to decide to violate the non-aggression principle.",4_1

Environmental degradation is one salient example. No C-suite executive of a petroleum company decides to continue operating the company even though burning fossil fuels is causing climate change in a morally-neutral context. The options for the oil executive are: 1) do the right thing and lose his or her job, shares of stock, and possibly other material possessions while in the process of switching industries; or 2) continue to profit while destroying the Earth. It's not as if the owner of a large amount of stock in a company with unethical business practices is not violating the non-aggression principle. Yet, people argue that the individual's right to his or her private property is more important than that person ceasing to violate others' individual rights to life, health, and sustainable futuresbecause people are willing to contradict their stated values of individual rights if it's in their own best interest. 
 
  
 In short, a value system that regards individual rights as the end-all and be-all for a just society is flawed. People cannot respect each other's individual rights unless each person recognizes that obedience to moral authority is a vital, important restriction of individual freedom. Conservatives thus argue that individual commitment to moral actionobedience to God by the members of a societyis sufficient to prevent people from acting selfishly, and that legal and economic liberalism can continue. Leftists argue that society needs to restrict the legal and economic freedoms of individuals because people make decisions according to self-interest, and will continue to act in ways that harm others until there are negative consequences that make harming others costly. Although these proposals for how selfish behavior must be controlled are divergent, both conservatives and leftists agree (in theory) that there is a higher authority for morality than the individual.",4_1_1

 If you are actually recommending or promoting abortion based on someone's circumstances (such as financial, college, or career situations), that's not pro-choice, that is advocating for abortions to happen, or pro-abortion, and that puts peer pressure on mothers to commit abortion whether they really wanted to or not, and it can make them feel guilty for not aborting/killing.
 
 I often see abortion promoted as ""the right thing to do"" for most if not nearly all circumstances someone might find themselves in, which is not pro-choice, that's pro-abortion.
 
 Pro-choice means you want abortion to be legal in case the mother decides to choose it. But the moment you recommend or promote abortion for particular circumstances, you are now advocating that abortions happen in those circumstances and trying to get mothers to make that decision, rather than advocating that the mother choose without that societal pressure. Recommending abortion for particular circumstances means you want more abortions to happen, at least as long as those circumstances apply.",4

 I've never encountered a pro-choice argument from liberalism that I've found convincing. Abortion violates the individual rights of the unborn. 
 
 Thus, it seems obvious that abortion is not moral according to liberal ethics. However, liberalism is ineffectual in guaranteeing that people act morally because humans make decisions based upon emotion. People rationalize choices that contradict their stated values. 
 
 In an ideal liberal society, people would act rationally for their own benefit and stop acting for their own benefit when it violated the non-aggression principle. But of course, people often keep acting for their own benefit even when it violates others' individual rights. The pro-choice position is nonsensical within a liberal, capitalist framework because **even rational choice the and ""invisible hand"" model** **recognize that people make choices based upon external situations**. It would be one thing if people always acted morally regardless of the consequences to themselves, but people don't. 
 
 Pro-choicers argue that abortion can be a moral choice, but the choice is never made in a morally-neutral context. Let's be honest about it: being a parent is extremely hard work, and becoming a parent is a huge commitment. Even if the biological parents of an infant choose to give up their kid for adoption, the uncertainty of whether or not an adoptive family will be found, the legal process, and the disruption of the parents' ""regular"", desired lives by the birth of child all can be seen as negative events the parents want to avoid. To be sure, there are many, many, many reasons that the parents of an aborted child might cite for why abortion was the right choicethey may *believe* that they were sparing their child from more suffering. However, the reasons people cite for getting abortions aside, the choice to abort is never made in a completely neutral context, wherein there's no option that's easier or better for the parents. When people choose abortion, they are acting rationally according to economic theorythey're acting in their own self-interest based upon a circumstance. If having conceived a child were not inconvenient to the parents, then they wouldn't even be considering abortion. No parents decide to abort a child they wanted who was conceived at a convenient time. Abortion is only considered at times when self-interest may well, well cause parents of unwanted children to decide to violate the non-aggression principle.",4_1

Environmental degradation is one salient example. No C-suite executive of a petroleum company decides to continue operating the company even though burning fossil fuels is causing climate change in a morally-neutral context. The options for the oil executive are: 1) do the right thing and lose his or her job, shares of stock, and possibly other material possessions while in the process of switching industries; or 2) continue to profit while destroying the Earth. It's not as if the owner of a large amount of stock in a company with unethical business practices is not violating the non-aggression principle. Yet, people argue that the individual's right to his or her private property is more important than that person ceasing to violate others' individual rights to life, health, and sustainable futuresbecause people are willing to contradict their stated values of individual rights if it's in their own best interest. 
 
  
 In short, a value system that regards individual rights as the end-all and be-all for a just society is flawed. People cannot respect each other's individual rights unless each person recognizes that obedience to moral authority is a vital, important restriction of individual freedom. Conservatives thus argue that individual commitment to moral actionobedience to God by the members of a societyis sufficient to prevent people from acting selfishly, and that legal and economic liberalism can continue. Leftists argue that society needs to restrict the legal and economic freedoms of individuals because people make decisions according to self-interest, and will continue to act in ways that harm others until there are negative consequences that make harming others costly. Although these proposals for how selfish behavior must be controlled are divergent, both conservatives and leftists agree (in theory) that there is a higher authority for morality than the individual.",4_1_1

 You are not alone. I repeat you are not alone. I was conceived in rape, and my biological grandmother wanted to force my biological mother to murder me in the womb. When I finally connected with my biological mother she shared horror stories of how her phone mother treated her while she was pregnant with me. She was forced to go out of state to have me in your own siblings didnt know she was ever pregnant. When she heard a Roman Catholic couple was going to adopt me she thought I would be raised rich because all she knew about Roman Catholics was the Kennedy family, and having just turned 19 didnt know any better but not every Roman Catholic was rich. She also didnt know that Walmart family that adopted me was extremely for which was OK by me as he taught me many lessons today value today, she didnt know my adoptive father is an alcoholic who is severely abusing his wife in with soon abuse me and all manner always did I hate talking about. 
 
 The family that adopted me did show because they did not want to stick out amongst their neighbors. Theres an old saying live like the Joneses such that if the Joneses have two cars you have two cars if the Joneses have a white picket fence you have a white picket fence and so on. So they literally did have a white picket fence and shes most of the neighborhood had two children they adopted two children.
 
 I was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused from around the age of five or six until I was thrown out of the house at the age of 19 to live on my own. In the physical did include worse.
 
 For 28 years I was pro abortion. I also hated God deeply. I did not find out I was adopted until I was seven years old when my grandmother who is the one who is predominantly raising me they were so safe to be around told me I was adopted. My alcoholic father disowned his own mother and would not allow me to go back to her for safety. He would tell me several times a week I was trash am I old mother didnt even want me.
 
 Jesus Christ shines the most high and only God saved me at age 28. He provided a miracle of allowing me to find my biological mother when it was a closed adoption. And between learning basic human biology as well as faith being in complete agreement with basic biology and basic science came to understand human life starts at conception in all life is valuable.
 
 There are a number of people strongly believe that if youre going to suffer or you should be killed before you go through the suffering. There are those who wouldve had me murdered in the womb because I was conceived in rape. There are those who think I would be better off dead because I grew up extremely poor. Ill never understand that point of view. My life is far from perfect. And Im sure if you gathered up the majority of the pro-life community we would all share similar stories of an imperfect life with more suffering that most can imagine and yet we still value life.
 
 You are not alone! Continue to stand firm! God bless.",1

 If you are actually recommending or promoting abortion based on someone's circumstances (such as financial, college, or career situations), that's not pro-choice, that is advocating for abortions to happen, or pro-abortion, and that puts peer pressure on mothers to commit abortion whether they really wanted to or not, and it can make them feel guilty for not aborting/killing.
 
 I often see abortion promoted as ""the right thing to do"" for most if not nearly all circumstances someone might find themselves in, which is not pro-choice, that's pro-abortion.
 
 Pro-choice means you want abortion to be legal in case the mother decides to choose it. But the moment you recommend or promote abortion for particular circumstances, you are now advocating that abortions happen in those circumstances and trying to get mothers to make that decision, rather than advocating that the mother choose without that societal pressure. Recommending abortion for particular circumstances means you want more abortions to happen, at least as long as those circumstances apply.",4

 I've never encountered a pro-choice argument from liberalism that I've found convincing. Abortion violates the individual rights of the unborn. 
 
 Thus, it seems obvious that abortion is not moral according to liberal ethics. However, liberalism is ineffectual in guaranteeing that people act morally because humans make decisions based upon emotion. People rationalize choices that contradict their stated values. 
 
 In an ideal liberal society, people would act rationally for their own benefit and stop acting for their own benefit when it violated the non-aggression principle. But of course, people often keep acting for their own benefit even when it violates others' individual rights. The pro-choice position is nonsensical within a liberal, capitalist framework because **even rational choice the and ""invisible hand"" model** **recognize that people make choices based upon external situations**. It would be one thing if people always acted morally regardless of the consequences to themselves, but people don't. 
 
 Pro-choicers argue that abortion can be a moral choice, but the choice is never made in a morally-neutral context. Let's be honest about it: being a parent is extremely hard work, and becoming a parent is a huge commitment. Even if the biological parents of an infant choose to give up their kid for adoption, the uncertainty of whether or not an adoptive family will be found, the legal process, and the disruption of the parents' ""regular"", desired lives by the birth of child all can be seen as negative events the parents want to avoid. To be sure, there are many, many, many reasons that the parents of an aborted child might cite for why abortion was the right choicethey may *believe* that they were sparing their child from more suffering. However, the reasons people cite for getting abortions aside, the choice to abort is never made in a completely neutral context, wherein there's no option that's easier or better for the parents. When people choose abortion, they are acting rationally according to economic theorythey're acting in their own self-interest based upon a circumstance. If having conceived a child were not inconvenient to the parents, then they wouldn't even be considering abortion. No parents decide to abort a child they wanted who was conceived at a convenient time. Abortion is only considered at times when self-interest may well, well cause parents of unwanted children to decide to violate the non-aggression principle.",4_1

Environmental degradation is one salient example. No C-suite executive of a petroleum company decides to continue operating the company even though burning fossil fuels is causing climate change in a morally-neutral context. The options for the oil executive are: 1) do the right thing and lose his or her job, shares of stock, and possibly other material possessions while in the process of switching industries; or 2) continue to profit while destroying the Earth. It's not as if the owner of a large amount of stock in a company with unethical business practices is not violating the non-aggression principle. Yet, people argue that the individual's right to his or her private property is more important than that person ceasing to violate others' individual rights to life, health, and sustainable futuresbecause people are willing to contradict their stated values of individual rights if it's in their own best interest. 
 
  
 In short, a value system that regards individual rights as the end-all and be-all for a just society is flawed. People cannot respect each other's individual rights unless each person recognizes that obedience to moral authority is a vital, important restriction of individual freedom. Conservatives thus argue that individual commitment to moral actionobedience to God by the members of a societyis sufficient to prevent people from acting selfishly, and that legal and economic liberalism can continue. Leftists argue that society needs to restrict the legal and economic freedoms of individuals because people make decisions according to self-interest, and will continue to act in ways that harm others until there are negative consequences that make harming others costly. Although these proposals for how selfish behavior must be controlled are divergent, both conservatives and leftists agree (in theory) that there is a higher authority for morality than the individual.",4_1_1

 It seems odd to me that doctors feel like they can't induce labor early and offer palliative care in this situation. It seems like that would be a lot safer than putting her on a plane to Colorado and killing the baby and THEN inducing labor.
 
 The problem here is that doctors want to push for abortion rather than allow for any risk of sepsis. In reality, some women with PPROM (preterm premature rupture of membranes) are able to remain pregnant and give birth to healthy babies.
 
 From a study that specifically focused on PPROM between 14 and 24 weeks (pre-viability):
 
 ""Previable PPROM represents a rare but significant challenge to obstetricians in terms of management. Most cases are managed expectantly. Despite advances in obstetric and neonatal care, perinatal prognosis remains poor. However, the risk of severe maternal morbidity and mortality is low. A quarter of these women can take home a live baby.""

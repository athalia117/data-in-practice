 Definitely, and to expand on your comment, I'll counter that by saying that so is pregnancy and birth. In fact, giving birth is *notorious* for causing people to develop mental illness. We don't say ""giving birth should be banned because some people develop anxiety/depression/psychosis/OCD/PTSD post partum!"". 
 

 Most people I know found their emotions running high at some point during pregnancy, and having a baby you love with your entire being is incredibly emotional as well. An abortion can probably be very emotional, but we're allowed to feel our emotions, and those emotions are always likely to be *better* when what we are doing was a free choice we made for ourselves, for the right reasons that are individual to each of us.
 

 We just want people to be *aware* it's a risk - that having a medical procedure, or going through a pregnancy will undoubtedly elicit an emotional response of some description - and understand that some people may be more at risk of potentially negative emotions than others. We should always be making our own decisions about what risks they are or aren't willing to take. Having emotions is just *so* fucking normal. Emotions happen with most things, even the most average day to day tasks. That's ok, in fact it is expected.",3_1_1_1

There's the risk of failure and needing a second procedure, the risk of infection, the risk of bleeding, the risk an individual may at some point regret their decision, a surgical abortion has a small risk of perforating the uterus etc. 
 

 The risks are pretty similar to any medical procedure really, and most of these complications (and more) can happen with pregnancy and birth anyway. Even needing a D&amp;C after giving birth because of retained products (usually parts of the placenta or the amniotic membranes).
 

 An abortion is 14x safer than pregnancy and birth in the US though. The risks are minute in comparison to pregnancy and birth. A medical abortion is so safe you can do it at home without any medical supervision at all. There are far less acute and long term complications with an abortion. 
 

 Pregnancy complications can reduce your life expectancy because they increase your risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders later in life. These can be life altering diagnoses. Getting gestational diabetes while pregnant means you have a 50% chance of developing permanent type 2 diabetes in the years following (which can reduce your life expectancy by about a decade) etc. 
 

 Any medical procedure is only worth the risk if an individual decides that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Even if abortion was more risky than pregnancy and birth, people should still have the right to decide whether or not to consent to it. The benefits can still outweigh the risks, and that is acceptable as long as people are making an informed choice. Just like *many* people decide that the benefits of gestation and birth are higher than the potential risks, and choose to have a baby. 
 

 If we were going to ban a procedure based on potential risks, pregnancy and birth should be banned before abortion. No one is suggesting that though, and the vast majority of the world would be absolutely outraged if such a proposal was made. It would be absurd to bam something only because it's potentially risky, when Cognizant people are more than capable of evaluating risk and benefits based on what will or will not meet their needs. 
 

 Organ transplants are a risky procedure, there's the possibility someone could become gravely ill and then die if their bodies suddenly reject the organ at a later date - we still allow people to decide to consent to those risks though. We take an organ out that is failing but ultimately still keeping the person alive, and replace it with one that can die completely and kill the person faster than the organ failure would have. They could die immediately *in* the operation! Just a general anaesthesia alone is a risk, but it's one people opt to take every hour of every day somewhere in this planet. 
 

 So many medical procedures are more likely to have complications of some degree (or completely fail!) than not. We still perform them on a case by case basis with a patients (or next of kin of the patient is incapacitated) consent. Ultimately, it is an individuals life and body, and they should be able to take whatever risks they are comfortable with. 
 

 People trek up deadly mountains, knowing there are corpses of people who died there frozen in time, that will stay there forever because no one is able or willing to take the risk to retrieve the bodies. People still go, they still have the right to risk spending eternity as a human sign post for others taking the potentially deadly trek. I personally cannot understand why trekking up a mountain known for killing people can be particularly enjoyable, it is not something I would enjoy at all. The only part I think I would enjoy, is the potential views - they'd make for a nice photo on a clear day. I still believe it's possible for other people to enjoy it in different ways, to believe that the potential benefits of having that experience outweigh the risks.",10

 No cons that I can think of, from my own perspective anyway. If I'd had to have an abortion during my so-happily-**over** reproductive years due to a BC failure, I wouldn't have had any regrets about it afterward. The only thing I would have regretted was **getting** pregnant in the first place. And I'd have been relieved that I was no longer pregnant.
 

 Some women may feel guilt or regret afterward, and that could be considered a *""con,""* but that does **not** mean abortion should be banned or restricted. Each person who has an abortion will feel differently depending on her circumstances. I don't believe there's a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to feel about abortion, other than it's **EACH** person's right to decide whether or not to have one.",13

Thank you for posting this. The heartlessness of placing a child in this position says much about the man you were speaking with. Of course, he can afford to be lacking any empathy in the situation.

Yet still, there are those sleepless nights when I wonder who that person might have become. I will wonder for the rest of my life.

 They think a breathing, feeling woman who can experience and suffer is worth no more than non breathing, a non-sentient, partially developed body that can't feel, experience, or suffer a thing.

 They think a breathing, feeling woman who can experience and suffer is worth no more than non breathing, a non-sentient, partially developed body that can't feel, experience, or suffer a thing.

 Definitely, and to expand on your comment, I'll counter that by saying that so is pregnancy and birth. In fact, giving birth is *notorious* for causing people to develop mental illness. We don't say ""giving birth should be banned because some people develop anxiety/depression/psychosis/OCD/PTSD post partum!"". 
 
 Most people I know found their emotions running high at some point during pregnancy, and having a baby you love with your entire being is incredibly emotional as well. An abortion can probably be very emotional, but we're allowed to feel our emotions, and those emotions are always likely to be *better* when what we are doing was a free choice we made for ourselves, for the right reasons that are individual to each of us.
 
 We just want people to be *aware* it's a risk - that having a medical procedure, or going through a pregnancy will undoubtedly elicit an emotional response of some description - and understand that some people may be more at risk of potentially negative emotions than others. We should always be making our own decisions about what risks they are or aren't willing to take. Having emotions is just *so* fucking normal. Emotions happen with most things, even the most average day to day tasks. That's ok, in fact it is expected.",3_1_1_1

There's the risk of failure and needing a second procedure, the risk of infection, the risk of bleeding, the risk an individual may at some point regret their decision, a surgical abortion has a small risk of perforating the uterus etc. 
 
 The risks are pretty similar to any medical procedure really, and most of these complications (and more) can happen with pregnancy and birth anyway. Even needing a D&amp;C after giving birth because of retained products (usually parts of the placenta or the amniotic membranes).
 
 An abortion is 14x safer than pregnancy and birth in the US though. The risks are minute in comparison to pregnancy and birth. A medical abortion is so safe you can do it at home without any medical supervision at all. There are far less acute and long term complications with an abortion. 
 
 Pregnancy complications can reduce your life expectancy because they increase your risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders later in life. These can be life altering diagnoses. Getting gestational diabetes while pregnant means you have a 50% chance of developing permanent type 2 diabetes in the years following (which can reduce your life expectancy by about a decade) etc. 
 
 Any medical procedure is only worth the risk if an individual decides that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Even if abortion was more risky than pregnancy and birth, people should still have the right to decide whether or not to consent to it. The benefits can still outweigh the risks, and that is acceptable as long as people are making an informed choice. Just like *many* people decide that the benefits of gestation and birth are higher than the potential risks, and choose to have a baby. 
 
 If we were going to ban a procedure based on potential risks, pregnancy and birth should be banned before abortion. No one is suggesting that though, and the vast majority of the world would be absolutely outraged if such a proposal was made. It would be absurd to bam something only because it's potentially risky, when Cognizant people are more than capable of evaluating risk and benefits based on what will or will not meet their needs. 
 
 Organ transplants are a risky procedure, there's the possibility someone could become gravely ill and then die if their bodies suddenly reject the organ at a later date - we still allow people to decide to consent to those risks though. We take an organ out that is failing but ultimately still keeping the person alive, and replace it with one that can die completely and kill the person faster than the organ failure would have. They could die immediately *in* the operation! Just a general anaesthesia alone is a risk, but it's one people opt to take every hour of every day somewhere in this planet. 
 
 So many medical procedures are more likely to have complications of some degree (or completely fail!) than not. We still perform them on a case by case basis with a patients (or next of kin of the patient is incapacitated) consent. Ultimately, it is an individuals life and body, and they should be able to take whatever risks they are comfortable with. 
 
 People trek up deadly mountains, knowing there are corpses of people who died there frozen in time, that will stay there forever because no one is able or willing to take the risk to retrieve the bodies. People still go, they still have the right to risk spending eternity as a human sign post for others taking the potentially deadly trek. I personally cannot understand why trekking up a mountain known for killing people can be particularly enjoyable, it is not something I would enjoy at all. The only part I think I would enjoy, is the potential views - they'd make for a nice photo on a clear day. I still believe it's possible for other people to enjoy it in different ways, to believe that the potential benefits of having that experience outweigh the risks.",10

 No cons that I can think of, from my own perspective anyway. If I'd had to have an abortion during my so-happily-**over** reproductive years due to a BC failure, I wouldn't have had any regrets about it afterward. The only thing I would have regretted was **getting** pregnant in the first place. And I'd have been relieved that I was no longer pregnant.
 
 Some women may feel guilt or regret afterward, and that could be considered a *""con,""* but that does **not** mean abortion should be banned or restricted. Each person who has an abortion will feel differently depending on her circumstances. I don't believe there's a ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to feel about abortion, other than it's **EACH** person's right to decide whether or not to have one.",13

 3. She is discovered to be pregnant from a sexual encounter that occurred before she entered that condition.
 
 4. Doctors monitoring her have deemed that the pregnancy is viable and that she can safely complete the pregnancy.
 
 Only then would I say that the other party involved in creating the ZEF *might* be in their right to have the pregnancy continue.
 
 As far as allowing the non-pregnant partner to absolve themself of parental rights and responsibility of care or contact, I agree that should always be an option.

 Im no lawyer or social worker, nor am I a single parent so I dont know what its like to raise a kid on a single income as a single parent, but I think if the partner is giving up their rights to the child they can also give up their duties to the child such as child support.

The pregnant person isnt being forced to raise a child poor, they still have the option to abort and, say, have half of the cost covered by the other partner.

 Imagine saying to a female rape victim, 'Lady, all you did was spread your legs for fucks sake.'
 
 That contemptuous sentence stinks of the presumption that boys and men always consent to sex with a woman.
 
 Also, here in Canada, guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. We don't throw a woman in jail based on an unproven allegation.
 
 Women can't have it both ways. I'm all for a woman's right to an abortion, but our reproductive laws have become way too gynocentric.
 
 Given how a male's reproductive rights end and obligations start at conception regardless of consent, and that sexual assault is extremely difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, I think that if the state decriminalizes abortion, then it should also make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.
 
 Fornication would be easier to prove than sexual assault and so provide a more effective deterrent against it.
 
 Unfortunately, feminists want everything, an unrestricted right to sex on demand, rape-shield laws to protect false accusers, and the free right to an abortion on demand. Men are screwed on all fronts.
 
 I think a reasonable compromise (if we truly believe in the equality of the sexes) would be to decriminalize abortion but then make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.That way, women would become more wary of sexually assaulting men (far more common than feminists acknowledge).",9_1_1

Pro-lifers are the ones who lack any and all empathy. That's why sentience doesn't matter to them. Suffering doesn't matter to them. They look at humans like non-feeling objects with some sort of value/worth/price tag.
 
 They think a breathing, feeling woman who can experience and suffer is worth no more than non breathing, a non-sentient, partially developed body that can't feel, experience, or suffer a thing.
 
 The only way to see the two as equal is to lack and any and all empathy.
 
 Don't let them get to you that much. You're dealing with sociopaths. They literally cannot comprehend empathy. They think projecting their own feelings onto non-feeling things is empathy.",3

 4. Doctors monitoring her have deemed that the pregnancy is viable and that she can safely complete the pregnancy.

 Im no lawyer or social worker, nor am I a single parent so I dont know what its like to raise a kid on a single income as a single parent, but I think if the partner is giving up their rights to the child they can also give up their duties to the child such as child support.

 Imagine saying to a female rape victim, 'Lady, all you did was spread your legs for fucks sake.'
 
 That contemptuous sentence stinks of the presumption that boys and men always consent to sex with a woman.
 
 Also, here in Canada, guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. We don't throw a woman in jail based on an unproven allegation.
 
 Women can't have it both ways. I'm all for a woman's right to an abortion, but our reproductive laws have become way too gynocentric.
 
 Given how a male's reproductive rights end and obligations start at conception regardless of consent, and that sexual assault is extremely difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, I think that if the state decriminalizes abortion, then it should also make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.
 
 Fornication would be easier to prove than sexual assault and so provide a more effective deterrent against it.
 
 Unfortunately, feminists want everything, an unrestricted right to sex on demand, rape-shield laws to protect false accusers, and the free right to an abortion on demand. Men are screwed on all fronts.
 
 I think a reasonable compromise (if we truly believe in the equality of the sexes) would be to decriminalize abortion but then make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.That way, women would become more wary of sexually assaulting men (far more common than feminists acknowledge).",9_1_1

 1. He has been specifically cleared by her to make medical decisions on her behalf in the event she is left unable to do so.
 
 2. She is in a state where she is 100% unable to receive communication or communicate her current needs/wants in any manner such as a permanant coma or vegetative state.
 
 3. She is discovered to be pregnant from a sexual encounter that occurred before she entered that condition.
 
 4. Doctors monitoring her have deemed that the pregnancy is viable and that she can safely complete the pregnancy.
 
 Only then would I say that the other party involved in creating the ZEF *might* be in their right to have the pregnancy continue.
 
 As far as allowing the non-pregnant partner to absolve themself of parental rights and responsibility of care or contact, I agree that should always be an option. No one should be forced to parent if they don't consent to it.

 My thoughts were based off the inseminating partner preferring an abortion and wanting to separate financially, legally and practically from the child that the pregnant partner is keeping.
 
 Im no lawyer or social worker, nor am I a single parent so I dont know what its like to raise a kid on a single income as a single parent, but I think if the partner is giving up their rights to the child they can also give up their duties to the child such as child support. (Especially if there was an agreement that any pregnancies would be aborted.) The pregnant person isnt being forced to raise a child poor, they still have the option to abort and, say, have half of the cost covered by the other partner.

 Imagine saying to a female rape victim, 'Lady, all you did was spread your legs for fucks sake.'
 
 That contemptuous sentence stinks of the presumption that boys and men always consent to sex with a woman.
 
 Also, here in Canada, guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. We don't throw a woman in jail based on an unproven allegation.
 
 Women can't have it both ways. I'm all for a woman's right to an abortion, but our reproductive laws have become way too gynocentric.
 
 Given how a male's reproductive rights end and obligations start at conception regardless of consent, and that sexual assault is extremely difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, I think that if the state decriminalizes abortion, then it should also make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.
 
 Fornication would be easier to prove than sexual assault and so provide a more effective deterrent against it.
 
 Unfortunately, feminists want everything, an unrestricted right to sex on demand, rape-shield laws to protect false accusers, and the free right to an abortion on demand. Men are screwed on all fronts.
 
 I think a reasonable compromise (if we truly believe in the equality of the sexes) would be to decriminalize abortion but then make fornication an offense punishable by a heavy fine that doubles for each repetition of the offense.That way, women would become more wary of sexually assaulting men (far more common than feminists acknowledge).",9_1_1

 He said he would rather ruin the 12 year old girl life than ""kill the baby"" , his excuse was ""You rather kill the baby"" ""I cry for those aborted babies"" ""The baby did nothing wrong"" I asked multiple times about what the 12 year old would feel and he didn't even bother to respond.
 I am furious , shaking , where is empathy ? He kept telling me that life starts at conception when I said scientists don't have consensus about when life begins and he didn't stop there.
 Am I the cold hearted one ? Am I the one who lacks empathy ? He gladly said he would ban abortions and I said ""A child shouldn't birth another child"" and his answer was ""Humans shouldn't kill another humans"".

Pro-lifers are the ones who lack any and all empathy. That's why sentience doesn't matter to them. Suffering doesn't matter to them. They look at humans like non-feeling objects with some sort of value/worth/price tag.
 
 They think a breathing, feeling woman who can experience and suffer is worth no more than non breathing, a non-sentient, partially developed body that can't feel, experience, or suffer a thing.
 
 The only way to see the two as equal is to lack and any and all empathy.

 Definitely, and to expand on your comment, I'll counter that by saying that so is pregnancy and birth. In fact, giving birth is *notorious* for causing people to develop mental illness. We don't say ""giving birth should be banned because some people develop anxiety/depression/psychosis/OCD/PTSD post partum!"". 
 
 Most people I know found their emotions running high at some point during pregnancy, and having a baby you love with your entire being is incredibly emotional as well. An abortion can probably be very emotional, but we're allowed to feel our emotions, and those emotions are always likely to be *better* when what we are doing was a free choice we made for ourselves, for the right reasons that are individual to each of us.
 
 We just want people to be *aware* it's a risk - that having a medical procedure, or going through a pregnancy will undoubtedly elicit an emotional response of some description - and understand that some people may be more at risk of potentially negative emotions than others. We should always be making our own decisions about what risks they are or aren't willing to take. Having emotions is just *so* fucking normal. Emotions happen with most things, even the most average day to day tasks. That's ok, in fact it is expected.",3_1_1_1

There's the risk of failure and needing a second procedure, the risk of infection, the risk of bleeding, the risk an individual may at some point regret their decision, a surgical abortion has a small risk of perforating the uterus etc. 
 
 The risks are pretty similar to any medical procedure really, and most of these complications (and more) can happen with pregnancy and birth anyway. Even needing a D&amp;C after giving birth because of retained products (usually parts of the placenta or the amniotic membranes).
 
 An abortion is 14x safer than pregnancy and birth in the US though. The risks are minute in comparison to pregnancy and birth. A medical abortion is so safe you can do it at home without any medical supervision at all. There are far less acute and long term complications with an abortion. 
 
 Pregnancy complications can reduce your life expectancy because they increase your risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders later in life. These can be life altering diagnoses. Getting gestational diabetes while pregnant means you have a 50% chance of developing permanent type 2 diabetes in the years following (which can reduce your life expectancy by about a decade) etc. 
 
 Any medical procedure is only worth the risk if an individual decides that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Even if abortion was more risky than pregnancy and birth, people should still have the right to decide whether or not to consent to it. The benefits can still outweigh the risks, and that is acceptable as long as people are making an informed choice. Just like *many* people decide that the benefits of gestation and birth are higher than the potential risks, and choose to have a baby. 
 
 If we were going to ban a procedure based on potential risks, pregnancy and birth should be banned before abortion. No one is suggesting that though, and the vast majority of the world would be absolutely outraged if such a proposal was made. It would be absurd to bam something only because it's potentially risky, when Cognizant people are more than capable of evaluating risk and benefits based on what will or will not meet their needs. 
 
 Organ transplants are a risky procedure, there's the possibility someone could become gravely ill and then die if their bodies suddenly reject the organ at a later date - we still allow people to decide to consent to those risks though. We take an organ out that is failing but ultimately still keeping the person alive, and replace it with one that can die completely and kill the person faster than the organ failure would have. They could die immediately *in* the operation! Just a general anaesthesia alone is a risk, but it's one people opt to take every hour of every day somewhere in this planet. 
 
 So many medical procedures are more likely to have complications of some degree (or completely fail!) than not. We still perform them on a case by case basis with a patients (or next of kin of the patient is incapacitated) consent. Ultimately, it is an individuals life and body, and they should be able to take whatever risks they are comfortable with. 
 
 People trek up deadly mountains, knowing there are corpses of people who died there frozen in time, that will stay there forever because no one is able or willing to take the risk to retrieve the bodies. People still go, they still have the right to risk spending eternity as a human sign post for others taking the potentially deadly trek. I personally cannot understand why trekking up a mountain known for killing people can be particularly enjoyable, it is not something I would enjoy at all. The only part I think I would enjoy, is the potential views - they'd make for a nice photo on a clear day. I still believe it's possible for other people to enjoy it in different ways, to believe that the potential benefits of having that experience outweigh the risks.",10

 No cons that I can think of, from my own perspective anyway.

 The clinic I volunteer at has mean people yelling at you as you walk in... you could feel lonely or judged or sad if you actually wanted to birth and couldn't.

 I'm talking about the fact that it will likely become a child if you don't have an abortion. To decide to have an abortion you need to consider what you're life will be like with and without a child, so it could be difficult to decide to not have a child now if the circumstances aren't right (even if you would want a child under different circumstances).
